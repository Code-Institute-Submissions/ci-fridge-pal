### A Fridge Inventory Management Website
Ever found yourself staring at a fridge full of forgotten items, only to realise they're past their expiry dates? I've been there too so many times. These everyday challenges inspired the creation of Fridge Pal inventory website â€” a simple solution to keep track of what's in your fridge, reduce food waste, make grocery shopping smarter and more efficient.
