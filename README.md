### A Fridge Inventory Management Website

Ever found yourself staring at a fridge full of forgotten items, only to realise they're past their expiry dates? I've been there too so many times. These everyday challenges inspired the creation of Fridge Pal inventory website — a simple solution to keep track of what's in your fridge, reduce food waste, make grocery shopping smarter and more efficient.

## User Experience (UX)

### UX Design

#### Overview

The fridge inventory website is designed to help users efficiently manage and track the contents of their fridge. By organizing items based on name, quantity, location, category, and expiry dates, the app aims to reduce food waste, save money, and ensure that users are always aware of what they have on hand. The app offers intuitive features like notifications for expiring items and easy categorization to enhance the user experience.

#### Target User Base

- **Home Cooks and Families**: Individuals or families who cook regularly and need to keep track of their groceries and leftovers. They want to reduce waste, save money, and ensure they always have fresh ingredients available.
- **Health-Conscious Users**: People focused on healthy eating who want to track the freshness and quality of their ingredients. They might also want to categorize items by dietary preferences, such as gluten-free, vegan, or organic.
- **Busy Professionals**: Users with hectic schedules who often forget what's in their fridge, leading to expired food. They need a quick and efficient way to manage their fridge inventory and receive reminders when items are about to expire.
- **Eco-Conscious Consumers**: Individuals who are concerned about food waste and want to make sure they use all the food they purchase. They are motivated by sustainability and environmental impact.

#### User Requirements

1. **Simple Item Addition and Removal**:
- Users should be able to add items to the inventory easily.
- The website should allow quick updates to item quantities as users consume or purchase more of an item.
2. **Categorization and Filtering**:
- Users should be able to categorise items into groups such as dairy, vegetables, meats, etc.
- The website should allow filtering by category, expiry date, or quantity to quickly find specific items.
3. **Expiry Date Notifications**:
- The website should notify users when items are expired.
- The website should notify users when items are approaching their expiry date, allowing them to prioritise usage.
4. **Inventory Overview and Insights**:
- A dashboard that provides a clear overview of the fridge's contents.
- Visual aids like icons (e.g., water droplet for fridge; snow flakes for freezer) can be used to help users quickly know whether the item is in the fridge or freezer compartment.

#### Goal

**Reduce Food Waste**:
The primary goal of the website is to help users minimise food waste by keeping track of what’s in their fridge and using items before they expire. This aligns with both economic savings for the user and environmental sustainability.

**Improve Organization and Efficiency**:
By providing a clear and organized view of fridge contents, the website aims to make meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking more efficient. Users should spend less time searching for ingredients and more time focusing on meal preparation.

**Encourage Sustainable Living**:
The website’s long-term goal is to encourage users to adopt more sustainable living practices by being mindful of food consumption and waste. Through features like recipe suggestions based on existing items (*this is a potential feature for future development*) and expiry notifications, the website supports a lifestyle that is both eco-friendly and cost-effective.

### User Flow Diagram

A simple user flow diagram was created to map out the logical path a user takes when interacting with the website. This diagram illustrates the process of user registration and login before accessing the inventory functionality, as well as the potential actions a logged-in user can take on the inventory (dashboard) page.
